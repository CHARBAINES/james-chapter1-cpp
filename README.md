# james-chapter1-cpp
This is a C++ program for looking up a Bible verse and viewing three versions of the verse at the same time for comparison and study.
For this test program I used the first chapter of the New Testament book of James.
The text is from the following versions: 
King James Version, New International Version, and Revised Standard Version.

The files used are:

functions.h, maps_header.h, functions.cpp, main.cpp

These have been compiled for Linux and Windows.


This program was a personal challenge to rewrite in C++ the Python program that I created for this lookup.

This gave me practice using header files, maps, functions, and linking of files at compile.
